        <h1>Supervised Learning</h1>
        <h2 class="display-5 fw-semibold"> Random Forest Decision Tree</h2>

<p>Initially, we cleaned the raw dataset in the data cleaning section of the notebook, transforming it into a more manageable format. Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data preprocessing pipeline for machine learning, involving the identification and correction of errors or inconsistencies to ensure high-quality data that is suitable for analysis or model training. Additional preprocessing was required to prepare the data for modeling, specifically for the Random Forest model.</p>

<h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>

<p>We loaded the cleaned data from our S3 bucket in a manner similar to the data cleaning section. The preprocessing steps included:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Feature Selection:</strong> We removed irrelevant features that do not contribute to model accuracy.</li>
    <li><strong>Feature Scaling: </strong> We categorized and binned certain columns and converted some features to boolean values for future one-hot encoding.</li>
    <li><strong>Sampling: </strong> To reduce computational load, we sampled 20% of the data for training and testing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following these steps, we applied Label Encoding to convert categorical features into numerical labels, setting the stage for model training with a Random Forest classifier.</p>

<h3>Predictive Modeling</h3>

<p>We employed predictive modeling to classify and forecast the severity of traffic accidents using the Random Forest model. the random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.  </p>

<p>The classification report shows how well the model performs for each class:</p>

<p>Overall, the model is strong in predicting "Non-severe" but less effective for "Severe" cases.The Random Forest model is 79% accurate. However, to understand how well the model performed, we need to compare the results for non-severe versus severe accidents.</p>

<p>The model performed well in predicting non-severe accidents, with a precision of 92% and a recall of 83%. This means the model accurately identifies most non-severe accidents. This is important for traffic management systems because it accurately identifies most low-severity accidents.</p>

<p>However, he model struggled with predicting severe accidents. It achieved only 35% precision in predicting severe accidents, meaning it misclassified 65% of cases as severe when they were not. The recall for severe accidents is 55%, indicating the model catches a little over half of the actual severe accidents but misses about 45%. Due to the lower precision and recall scores for severe accidents, there is a potential risk for the system, as it may misclassify severe accidents, either failing to predict them or overestimating their likelihood.</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>Further efforts could include experimenting with different hyperparameters or balancing techniques to continue improving the model's ability to accurately predict severe cases. Continued fine-tuning will be important as the model is applied to real-world data to ensure it performs consistently well across all classes.</p>
