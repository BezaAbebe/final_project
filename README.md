Project 4

Traffic Accident Severity Prediction
Introduction
This project aims to predict the severity of traffic accidents based on factors such as weather, road conditions, and traffic. Accurate predictions can assist law enforcement and emergency services in better preparation, potentially saving lives and resources. It can also alert drivers to exercise caution or alter their routes to avoid severe accidents.
Slide 6: Tools and Technologies
â€¢	Technologies Used:
o	AWS S3 for data storage.
o	Python for data cleaning and processing.
o	Pandas for data manipulation.


Project Structure
This project is divided into four main parts:
1.	Data Cleaning and Visualization
o	Cleaning raw data, handling missing values, and visualizing key patterns and trends.
o	Data Cleaning Notebook
2.	Preprocessing and Exploration
o	Preparing data for modeling by scaling, encoding, and exploring relationships between features.
3.	Modeling and Optimization
o	Unsupervised Learning: Applying clustering techniques and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to understand data distribution and reduce dimensionality.
o	Unsupervised Learning Notebook
o	Supervised Learning: Developing and optimizing a Random Forest model to predict traffic accident severity.
o	Supervised Learning Notebook
Model Initialization and Optimization
The model was initialized using the following code:
